# Outbound Sales Analytics – End‑to‑End Portfolio Project

## Project Overview

This project presents an **outbound sales performance analysis** using existing operational data across leads, outreach activities, meetings, and opportunity outcomes.

The analysis focuses on understanding **how outbound efforts perform across channels, follow‑ups, lead sources, and geographies**, and how these factors influence funnel progression from lead creation to deal closure.

---

## Business Objectives

* Measure **lead‑to‑win funnel conversion**
* Evaluate **outreach channel effectiveness**
* Understand **follow‑up sequence impact** on responses
* Identify **high‑quality lead sources**
* Analyze **geographic and pipeline performance**
* Provide **data‑driven recommendations** for sales optimization

## Data Model & Architecture

### Data Sources

The analysis is based on structured datasets representing outbound sales operations, including lead details, outreach interactions, meetings, and opportunity outcomes.

### Tables Used

| Table Name             | Description                                                    |
| ---------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `leads_master`         | Lead, company, role, source, and geography information         |
| `outreach_activity`    | Outreach interactions across Email, LinkedIn, and Cold Calling |
| `meetings`             | Meetings booked with prospects                                 |
| `opportunity_outcomes` | Final opportunity status and loss reasons                      |
| `lead_funnel_status`   | Derived funnel stage per lead                                  |

### Data Modeling Highlights

* **Star schema design** with `leads_master` as the dimension table

## Outreach Process Overview

Outbound engagement follows a structured multi‑channel sequence:

```
Email → LinkedIn → Cold Call
(repeated across follow‑up attempts until response)
```

Key characteristics of the outreach process:

* Prospects may respond at any stage of follow‑up
* Once a response is received, further outreach is discontinued
* Meetings are booked only after a positive response

This structure enables analysis of follow‑up effectiveness and channel efficiency.

## Power BI Dashboard

The Power BI dashboard is structured into **4 analytical views**:

### 1. Funnel Overview

* Lead → Response → Meeting → Win funnel
* Funnel stage distribution (Cold / Warm / Hot)
* Executive KPI cards

### 2. Outreach Performance

* Response rate by channel
* Meeting conversion rate by channel
* Response rate by follow‑up attempt

### 3. Source Analysis

* Meetings generated by lead source
* Win rate by lead source
* Source‑wise contribution to revenue

### 4. Pipeline Insights

* Meetings & wins by country
* Win rate by geography
* Top reasons for lost opportunities

## Key Business Insights

* 1. **LinkedIn** is the most effective channel for both responses and meetings
* 2. Follow‑ups are critical — most responses occur after **attempt 3+**
* 3. Large drop‑off occurs between **response and meeting booking**
* 4. Certain lead sources generate **fewer but higher‑quality opportunities**
* 5. The **US market** drives the majority of wins
* 6. Many losses are due to **process delays**, not lead quality

---

## Recommendations

* 1. Prioritize **LinkedIn** for outbound outreach
* 2. Maintain a **4–5 step follow‑up cadence**
* 3. Improve meeting booking CTAs and post‑response follow‑ups
* 4. Focus sales efforts on **high win‑rate lead sources**
* 5. Allocate outbound resources primarily to the **US market**
